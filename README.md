""" Single pulse plotting tools..."""

""" Waterfaller   : Plots frequency vs time. Shows dispersed/ de-dispersed pulse depending on the parameters given.
    sp_pipeline   : Automatically generates single pulse plots and corresponding .spd files (binary .npz files). 
                    The plot contains:
                    1. Waterfall de-dispersed plot with the dispersed plot as an inset with the zero-dm filter ON and OFF.
                    2. The corresponding time series to the above plots.
                    3. Signal to noise vs DM
                    4. DM vs time.
                    5. Relavant information to the plot.
    sp_pgplot     : Contains Pgplot commands to make the 2D - waterfall plots for the plots generated by sp_pipeline.py . Also contains other important functions for making the DM vs time subplot.
    bary_and_topo : Returns topocentric and the corresponding barycentric times that are required to correct for the offset in the waterfall plots generated by sp_pipeline.
    show_spplots  : Makes the same single pulse plot as that generated by sp_pipeline from the .spd 
                    file as an input. """
